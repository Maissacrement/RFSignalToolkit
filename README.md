# Android toolkit audit and prevent attack

## INTRODUCTION

First, I will introduce the working environment by talking about hardware constraints.
The recordings were made with a Samsung Galaxy S9+ using a magnetometer model "Magnetic Sensor, 1209-002401". The sensor expresses a magnetic field vector of format B(x,y,z) expressed in uT. For the moment I have no more information to bring you.
The objective from an application point of view is to get the most information from this signal. For that a file describing the signal is provided whose dataset can be improved if needed.
