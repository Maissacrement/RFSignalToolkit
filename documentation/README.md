# Intro

Depending on the quality of the signal studied, it is subject to different properties of 
propagation in space. The wave has therefore a property differentiated by area of propagation:

Zone de Rayleigh: [ lambda/2pi; D^2/2lambda ]

Zone de Fresnel: [ 2D²/lambda; ]

Zone de Fraunhoffer: [ 2D²/lambda; ]
